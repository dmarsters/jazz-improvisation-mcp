# NATURAL TRANSFORMATIONS: How one dimension scales with another
natural_transformations:
  harmonic_complexity_drives_phrasing_response:
    when: "harmonic_foundation complexity increases"
    then: "phrasing_clarity must increase (shorter phrases, more singularity, more rest)"
    monk_evidence: "Epistrophy simple vamp enables long exploration; Evidence dense harmony requires punctuation"
    
  intensity_requires_clarity:
    when: "intensity_arc increases"
    then: "rest_space must increase proportionally (counterintuitively)"
    principle: "Higher density requires silence to remain legible"
    monk_evidence: "Monk's busiest passages have most deliberate rest"

  temporal_displacement_needs_harmonic_anchor:
    when: "beat_relationship moves away from 1 (toward behind-beat)"
    then: "harmonic_clarity must increase—listener needs harmonic roadmap"
    monk_principle: "Behind-the-beat phrasing requires crystal harmonic navigation"

# COMMUTATIVE DIAGRAMS: Ensure coherence
coherence_constraints:
  diagram_1:
    name: "Harmonic Foundation → Intensity Arc → Clarity"
    principle: "More complex harmony requires balanced intensity & clear phrasing"
    violation_example: "Dense harmony + high density + low clarity = incomprehensible"
    monk_counter_example: "Dense harmony + controlled density + high clarity = Monk's mastery"

  diagram_2:
    name: "Pacing Deformation → Intensity Response"
    principle: "Behind-the-beat playing requires even spacing/clarity to navigate"
    monk_principle: "Monk's time is deformed but his phrasing is *architectural*"

    statement: "Monk treats harmonic constraint as compositional material, not limitation"
    manifests_as: "reharmonization, tritone substitution, chromatic approach within changes"
    
  silence_as_structure:
    statement: "Rests are not breaks but architectural elements"
    manifests_as: "high rest_space in development, creates legibility despite complexity"
    
  rhythmic_displacement:
    statement: "Behind-the-beat phrasing as fundamental approach"
    manifests_as: "beat_relationship consistently 7-9, enables swing feel despite angular harmony"
    
  dissonance_as_truth:
    statement: "Harmonic tension is never smoothed—it's revealed and resolved"
    manifests_as: "high harmonic_complexity with intentional tritone/cluster voicing"

    visual_analog: "sharp focus, defined edge, established baseline"

    visual_analog: "layering, density increasing, pattern emerging from chaos"
